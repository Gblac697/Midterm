This code took me ~15 hours to complete. This was due to my lack of knowledge and if done again it would go faster.
The hardest part was the test code was not working and need a soild 5 hours to get to work.
In retrospect, re-writing code was a bad choice, as often it would not even make a better code. I should have stuck to what worked and moved on.
I wrote all the code myself in order to learn every thing I could about codeing. Libaries also would not be that useful for my projest as it was mostly writiing print functions.
The code is a simple chose you own adventure with inputs in the terminal. You look around four areas with two types of endings. One where you escape and one where you do not. 
These ending rely on your use of items and area knowledge. Can you escape the Forest?
